## The Python Requests Library

Up to now, we've seen how we can serialize the data that we have in our programs and turn it into a format that we can store on disk. Once the data is stored, another process can open up those files, de-serialize them, and go from there.

This works, but only if the other process has access to the same filesystem you used to store your data. What if you wanted to send a message to another computer on another network? HTTP to the rescue!

Remember that **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the protocol of the world-wide web. When you visit a webpage with your web browser, the browser is making a series of **HTTP requests** to web servers somewhere out on the Internet. Those servers will answer with **HTTP responses**. This is also how we’re going to send and receive messages with web applications from our code.

The [Python Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) makes it super easy to write programs that send and receive HTTP. Instead of having to understand the HTTP protocol in great detail, you can just make very simple HTTP connections using Python objects, and then send and receive messages using the methods of those objects. Let's look at an example:

```python
>>> import requests
>>> response = requests.get('https://www.google.com')
```

That's it! That was a basic request for a web page! We used the Requests library to make a **HTTP GET** request for a specific **URL, or Uniform Resource Locator**. The URL tells the Requests library the name of the resource (**www.google.com**) and what protocol to use to get the resource (**https://**). The result we get is an object of type
requests.Response.

Alright, now what did the web server respond with? Let's take a look at the first 300 characters of the
Response.text:

```python
>>> print(response.text[:300])
<!doctype html><html itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage" lang="de"><head><meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type"><meta content="/images/branding/googleg/1x/googleg_standard_color_128dp.png" itemprop="image"><title>Google</title><script nonce="dZfbIAn803LDGXS9
```

Now, it might be hard for you to read the **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** that was returned in this response, but your web browser knows just how to turn that into a familiar-looking web page.

Even with this simple example, the Requests module has done a whole lot of work for us! We didn't have to write any code to find the web server, make a network connection, construct an HTTP message, wait for a response, or decode the response. Not that HTML can't be messy enough on its own, but let's look at the first bytes of the **raw** message that we received from the server:

```python
>>> response = requests.get('https://www.google.com', stream=True)
>>> print(response.raw.read()[:100])
b'\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\xff\xc5Z\xdbz\x9b\xc8\x96\xbe\xcfS`\xf2\xb5-\xc6X\x02$t\xc28\xe3v\xdc\xdd\xee\xce\xa9\xb7\xdd;\xe9\x9d\xce\xf6W@\t\x88\x11`@>D\xd6\x9b\xce\xe5<\xc3\\\xcd\xc5\xfc\xab8\x08\xc9Nz\x1f.&\x8e1U\xb5j\xd5:\xfc\xb5jU\x15\x87;^\xe2\x16\xf7)\x97\x82b\x1e\x1d\x1d\xd2S'
```

What's all that? The response was compressed with gzip, so it had to be decompressed before we could even read the text of the HTML. One more thing that the Requests library handled for us!

The [requests.Response](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Response) object also contains the exact request that was created for us. We can check out the headers stored in our object to see that the Requests module told the web server that it was okay to compress the content:

```python
>>> response.request.headers['Accept-Encoding']
'gzip, deflate'
```

And then the server told us that the content had actually been compressed.

```python
>>> response.headers['Content-Encoding']
'gzip'
```

And all this happened by default, without us having to do anything special to make it work. Amazing, right?

## Useful Operations for Python Requests

There's a ton of things that we can do with Python Requests. We'll cover some of the most important features here and give you pointers for more information at the end.

First, how do we know if a request we made got a successful response? You can check out the value of [Response.ok](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Response.ok), which will be **True** if the response was good, and **False** if it wasn't.

```python
>>> response.ok
True
```

Now, keep in mind that this will only tell you if the web server says that the response successfully fulfilled the request. The response module can’t determine if that data that you got back is the kind of data that you were expecting. You'll need to do your own checking for that!

If the boolean isn’t specific enough for your needs, you can get the [HTTP response code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) that was returned by looking at [Response.status_code](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/#requests.Response.ok):

```python
>>> response.status_code
200
```

Excellent! To write maintainable, stable code, you’ll always want to check your responses to make sure they succeeded before trying to process them further. For example, you could do something like this:

```python
response = requests.get(url)
if not response.ok:
    raise Exception("GET failed with status code {}".format(response.status_code))
```

But you don't really need to do that. Requests has us covered here, too! We can use the **Response.raise_for_status()** method, which will raise an **HTTPError** exception only if the response wasn’t successful.

```python
response = requests.get(url)
response.raise_for_status()
```

## HTTP GET and POST Methods

HTTP supports several **HTTP methods**, like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. We're going to spend time on the two most common HTTP requests: GET and POST.

The **HTTP GET method**, of course, retrieves or **gets** the resource specified in the URL. By sending a GET request to the web server, you’re asking for the server to GET the resource for you. When you’re browsing the web, most of what you’re doing is using your web browser to issue a whole bunch of GET requests for the text, images, videos, and so forth that your browser will display to you.

A GET request can have **parameters**. Have you ever seen a URL that looked like this?

```bash
https://example.com/path/to/api/cat_pictures?search=grey+kitten&max_results=15
```

The question mark separates the URL resource from the resource's parameters. These parameters are one or more key-value pairs, formatted as a
**query string**. In the example above, the **search** parameter is set to "grey+kitten", and the **max_results** parameter is set to 15.

But you don't have to write your own code to create an URL like that one. With **requests.get()**, you can provide a dictionary of parameters, and the Requests module will construct the correct URL for you!

```python
>>> p = {"search": "grey kitten",
...      "max_results": 15}
>>> response = requests.get("https://example.com/path/to/api", params=p)
>>> response.request.url
'https://example.com/path/to/api?search=grey+kitten&max_results=15'
```

You might notice that using parameters in Requests is yet another form of data serialization. Query strings are handy when we want to send small bits of information, but as our data becomes more complex, it can get hard to represent it using query strings.

An alternative in that case is using the H**TTP POST method**. This method sends, or **posts**, data to a web service. Whenever you fill a web form and press a button to submit, you're using the POST method to send that data back to the web server. This method tends to be used when there's a bunch of data to transmit.

In our scripts, a POST request looks very similar to a GET request. Instead of setting the **params** attribute, which gets turned into a query string and appended to the URL, we use the data attribute, which contains the **data** that will be sent as part of the POST request.

```python
>>> p = {"description": "white kitten",
...      "name": "Snowball",
...      "age_months": 6}
>>> response = requests.post("https://example.com/path/to/api", data=p)
```

Let's check out the generated URL for this request:

```python
>>> response.request.url
'https://example.com/path/to/api'
```

See how much simpler the URL is on this POST now? Where did all of the parameters go? They’re part of the **body** of the HTTP message. We can see them by checking out the **body** attribute.

```python
>>> response.request.body
'description=white+kitten&name=Snowball&age_months=6'
```

Ah, ha! There they are!

So, if we need to send and receive data from a web service, we can turn our **data** into dictionaries and then pass that as the data attribute of a POST request.

Today, it's super common to send and receive data specifically in JSON format, so the Requests module can do the conversion directly for us, using the **json** parameter.

```python
>>> response = requests.post("https://example.com/path/to/api", json=p)
>>> response.request.url
'https://example.com/path/to/api'
>>> response.request.body
b'{"description": "white kitten", "name": "Snowball", "age_months": 6}'
```

And that's it for our brief introduction to the Requests module. If you want to learn more, feel free to work through the
**Requests Quickstart.**

In the project at the end of this module, you’ll use the Requests module to interact with a web application. This simple application was created using the Django web framework. So, what's that, exactly? Read on to learn more!

## What is Django?

The lab project at the end of this module will feature a very simple web application created using [Django](https://djangoproject.com/). Django is a **full-stack web framework** written in Python. For this project, you'll only need to interact with it through HTTP requests, but it's still a good idea to understand what it is, and when it would be a good tool for you to use.

A full-stack web framework handles a bunch of different components that are typical when creating a web application. It contains libraries that help you handle each of the pieces: writing your application's code, storing and retrieving data, receiving web requests, and responding to them. If you need to build an application that has a web frontend, using a web framework like Django can save you a lot of time and effort, because a lot of challenges are already solved for you.

Web frameworks are commonly split into three basic components: (1) the application code, where you'll add all of your application's logic; (2) the data storage, where you'll configure what data you want to store and how you're storing it; and (3) the web server, where you'll state which pages are served by which logic.

Splitting your code like that helps you write more modular code, promotes code reuse, and allows for flexibility when viewing and accessing data. For example, you could have a simple web page where users of the system can access the information already stored in it, and a separate programmatic interface that can be used by other scripts or applications to transmit data to the system.

When you’re writing a web application, there's a ton of little decisions to make. Relying on a framework like Django is similar to using external libraries for your code. There are a lot of features, which you can use very easily, instead of writing everything from scratch and re-making all of the same mistakes that we all make when writing a web application for the first time.

Django has a ton of useful components for building websites. In the lab project, Django will be used for serving the company website, including customer reviews. It does this by taking the request for a URL and parsing it using the **urlresolver** module. This is a core module in Django that interprets URL requests and matches them against a list of defined patterns. If a URL matches a pattern, the request is passed to the associated function, called a **view**. This allows you to serve different pages depending on what URL is being requested. You can even build complex logic into the function handling the request to make more dynamic, interactive, and exciting pages.

Django can also handle reading and writing data from a database, letting you store and retrieve data used by your application. In the lab, the database holds the customer reviews for the company. When a user loads the website, the logic will ask the database for all available customer reviews. These are retrieved and formatted into a web page, which is served as a response to the URL request. Django makes it easy to interact with data stored in a database by using an **object-relational mapper**, or **ORM**. This tool provides an easy mapping between data models defined as Python classes and an underlying database that stores the data in question.

On top of this, the Django application running in the lab includes an **endpoint** that can be used to add new customer reviews to the database. This endpoint is configured to receive data in JSON format, sent through an HTTP POST request. The data transmitted will then be stored in the database and added to the list of all reviews. The framework even generates an interactive web form, that lets us directly interact with the endpoint using our browser, which can be really handy for testing and debugging.

Django is one of many popular web frameworks. Alternative Python-based web frameworks similar to Django include [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html), [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/), [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/), and [CubicWeb](https://www.cubicweb.org/).There are a host of other frameworks written in other languages too, not just Python.
